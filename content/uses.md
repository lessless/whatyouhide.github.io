# `/uses` Page

Nice find! ðŸ™Œ `/uses` is a nice sort of personal-website standard where people
post stuff they use to do their work or just in their life. I swear it is, but I
can't find a link about this anywhere now.

## Software

I'm a software engineer, so I use computers and software a lot, but who doesn't
these days anyway.

### Computerz

I use macOS as my main OS.

#### macOS Apps

  * [VS Code][vscode] as my main text editor.
  * [iTerm 2][iterm] as my terminal.
  * [1Password] for password management. I pay for a family subscription, and I
    think 1Password might be my favorite piece of software ever?
  * [Dash] for consulting documentation. It's an app that aggregates
    documentation from different software, programming languages, and ecosystems
    (it supports [hex.pm](https://hex.pm) packages!!). It lets you search though
    everything. Just awesome.
  * [Obsidian] for taking notes.
  * **Mail.app** (the default) for email.
  * **Calendar.app** (the default) for calendars.
  * **Reminders.app** (the default) for reminders.
  * **Keynote.app** for giving talks.
  * [TablePlus] for talking to databases.
  * [Alfred] to do *a lot of stuff*. I launch apps with it, run little scripts
    that I wrote as extensions, use it for clipboard management, for snippets,
    as a calculator, and probably more.

I also use a lot of little utilities here and there to make life on macOS more
pleasant.

  * I use [Magnet] to move my windows around.
  * [AltTab] lets me command-tab my way around much better than the default.
  * [CleanShot X][cleanshot] to take screenshots. I'm a nerd for screenshots.
