Sometimes I end up teaching stuff, mostly about [Elixir] and related topics.
Here's a more-or-less-complete list of materials, but head over to [the
blog](/blog) as well for more.

## Interactive Guide to Asynchronous Data Processing in Elixir

I wrote an interactive guide on asynchronous data processing in Elixir, in the
form of a series of [Livebooks][livebook] that you can read and experiment with.

The material is [on GitHub][guide-async-processing-repo].

## Protohackers in Elixir

This is a screencast series where I solve some network programming puzzles in
Elixir. The challenges are provided by [Protohackers], a website I recently
found on the interwebs (it's sort of like [Advent of Code][advent-of-code-post],
but for network challenges). You can find all the videos in this post.

Here's the playlist on YouTube:
